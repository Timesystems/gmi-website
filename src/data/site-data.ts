I was thrilled when they came and conducted their program for stakeholders in our tertiary institutions. I'm even happier to see that some institutions have already embraced it.
Being invited for a 30-minute live TV show to educate the public about the program was an honor and a testament to its impact. I sincerely hope Gender Mobile's presence in our state continues to grow, and I am committed to providing every possible support.
Thank you so much, Gender Mobile—I am so proud of all you do. Keep up the excellent work!
