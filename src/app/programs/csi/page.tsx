        Executive Summary
      </h3>
      <p>
        Sexual harassment has unfortunately become a pervasive issue within
        learning environments, particularly in tertiary institutions across
        Nigeria. Shocking statistics from a study on Community Health Education
        by Owoaje E.T. and Olusola Taiwo revealed that 69.8% of respondents
        experienced sexual harassment during their time as students in tertiary
        institutions. Perpetrators often include male classmates and lecturers,
        highlighting the urgent need for intervention.

        Understanding the Problem
      </h3>
      <p>
        The prevalence of sexual harassment can be attributed to various
        factors, including:
      </p>
      <ul className='tab-content-list'>
        <li>Poor Responses: Both at individual and institutional levels.</li>
        <li>
          Lack of Comprehensive Policies: Many institutions lack clear policies
          addressing sexual harassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ineffective Implementation: Even when policies exist, they are often
          poorly implemented.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of Reporting Channels: Students may feel reluctant to report
          incidents due to a lack of accessible reporting channels.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Our Approach
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-3'>
        The Campus Safety Initiative aims to tackle sexual harassment in higher
        educational institutions through a comprehensive approach. Our strategy
        is built on four key pillars
      </p>
      <ul className='tab-content-list'>
        <li>
          Research and Policies: We advocate for the development and
          implementation of robust policies to address sexual harassment on
          campuses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bystander Intervention: Encouraging students and staff to intervene
          and support victims when witnessing instances of harassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preventative Education: Providing educational programs and workshops
          to raise awareness about sexual harassment and empower individuals to
          recognize and prevent it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technology Integration: Leveraging technology for case reporting, data
          collection, access to information services, and dissemination of
          institutional policies.

        Our Impact
      </h3>
      <p>
        Drawing from personal angle stories collected from various Nigerian
        institutions, including Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Ede
        Polytechnic, Tai Solarin University, and Lagos State University, we
        understand the urgency of addressing this issue. By implementing
        sustainable strategies that complement and reinforce one another, we aim
        to create safer and more respectful learning environments for all
        students.

        Deliverables of the Project
      </h3>
      <ul className='tab-content-list'>
        <li>
          Provide technical support to institutions through their policy
          validation process.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Print up to 100 copies of the policy to be distributed across faculty
          libraries
        </li>
        <li>
          Build the capacity of 100 Campus Ambassadors in each Institution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support Institutions to set up an independent Sexual Harassment
          Prohibition Committee.Â

        Learning Points
      </h3>
      <ul className='tab-content-list'>
        <li>
          External effort to address sexual harassment should be participatory
          to enable institutions take ownership of the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          When Institutions own such processes, they will create an enabling
          environment for such policy frameworks to thrive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopting the bottom-top approach has proven more effective in
          mobilizing interest of key stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Institutions are more interested in efforts that will strengthen their
          institutional capacity to be more responsive.
